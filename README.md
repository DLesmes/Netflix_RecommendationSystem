Study case Netflix Recommendation System

We can use the following methods to solve de case
1. Linner regression
2. knn
3. random forest

with a powerfull machine!! 

so  the theory says that we have to use Loss function and Regularization techniques, analyzing the effect of the different variables on ratings (genres, year, timestamp, etc). Other usefull technique is Matrix Factorization but with Regularization, you can report a RMSE less than 0.86490.

you can add regularization to the movies and user efect, genres and year... with a unique lamda or independen lambda for each paramether

Data clean is important in order to facilitate the analysis: p.e. filter users that have voted, at least, X times, convert Timestamp variable to a date, extract the year of the movies, etc.
